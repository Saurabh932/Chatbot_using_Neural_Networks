# Chatbot_using_Neural_Networks

### Build a Chatbot Using Neural Networks
This project is a Python implementation of a chatbot using neural networks. The chatbot is designed to simulate conversation with a user and provide relevant responses based on the user's input. The chatbot is built using Keras, a high-level neural networks API.

### Getting Started
To use the chatbot, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need to install the following Python packages:

  keras<br/>
  numpy<br/>
  nltk<br/>
  
#### You can install these packages using pip:<br/>
pip install keras numpy nltk<br/>
<br/>After installing the required packages, you can run the chatbot.ipynb notebook to start the chatbot. The notebook contains the code for training the neural network and for simulating conversation with the user.

### How to Use
When you run the chatbot.ipynb notebook, you can start a conversation with the chatbot by typing in a message and pressing enter. The chatbot will then provide a response based on the input.

### Results
The chatbot is able to provide relevant responses based on the input from the user. The neural network was trained on a dataset of intents and responses, allowing it to understand the context of the user's input and generate an appropriate response. The chatbot can be used to simulate conversation and provide support to users in various applications, such as customer service or information retrieval.
